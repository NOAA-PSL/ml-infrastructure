# ml-infrastructure
(In development) An agile framework for leveraging machine learning in numerical weather prediction research


## Branches & PRs

For development, we recommend creating a branch off of `develop` following the below naming conventions:
- `documentation/user_branch_name`: Documenation additions and/or corrections
- `feature/user_branch_name`: Enhancements/upgrades
- `fix/user_branch_name`: Bug-type fixes
- `hotfix/user_branch_name`: Bug-type fixes which require immediate attention and are required to fix significant issues that compromise the integrity of the software

Once the desired contributions are complete in your branch, submit a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into `develop`.
Also note that all python coding additions should follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
We will use the "squash merge" feature on PRs that we merge to consolidate the commit history.

When features are completed (or other significant milestones worthy of a release are reached), we will open a PR to `main` and tag the release.
